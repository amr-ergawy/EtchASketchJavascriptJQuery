# EtchASketchJavascriptJQuery-TheOdinProject

This is an Etch-A-Sketch board inspired by the JavaScript and JQuery project of the web development course TheOdinProject, http://www.theodinproject.com/. 

The board layout is made dynamic enough to fit both chosen rowsXcols size and the browser window. 

Because of using HSL colors, the board is compatible with IE9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and in Opera 10+. 

Zooming is not processed in any custom way.

Test on IE, Chrome, and FireFox.
