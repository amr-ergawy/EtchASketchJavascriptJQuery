# EtchASketchJavascriptJQuery

This is an Etch-A-Sketch board inspired by the JavaScript and JQuery project of the web development course TheOdinProject, http://www.theodinproject.com/. 

The board layout is made smart enough to fit both chosen rowsXcols size and the browser window.

The "Custom detail" button can be used to test the flexible board layout.

Because of using HSL colors, the board is compatible with IE9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and in Opera 10+. 

Window resizing is done in an optimizied way using only a portion of the auto-fitting computation of grid resizing.

Zooming is not processed in any custom way.

Be aware that the hosting service heroku takes time to wake up an app that was not visited for a while, which may be the case for this site. 

Tested on IE, Chrome, and FireFox.
