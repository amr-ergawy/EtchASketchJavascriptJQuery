# EtchASketchJavascriptJQuery

This is an Etch-A-Sketch board inspired by the JavaScript and JQuery project of the web development course TheOdinProject, http://www.theodinproject.com/. 

The board layout is made smart enough to fit both chosen rowsXcols size and the browser window.

The "Custom resize" button can be used to test the flexible board layout.

Because of using HSL colors, the board is compatible with IE9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and in Opera 10+. 

Zooming is not processed in any custom way.

Tested on IE, Chrome, and FireFox.
